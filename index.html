        <h2>Tips to Help Save the Climate & Environment üå±</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle: Limit waste by reusing items and recycling materials whenever possible.</li>
            <li>Conserve Water: Save water by taking shorter showers and turning off taps when not in use.</li>
            <li>Use Public Transport or Carpool: Help reduce air pollution by using public transport, biking, or walking.</li>
            <li>Plant Trees: Trees absorb CO‚ÇÇ, so planting more trees can help combat climate change.</li>
            <li>Save Electricity: Turn off lights and appliances when not needed, and consider energy-efficient options.</li>
            <li>Eat Less Meat: Producing meat requires a lot of resources, so eating less of it helps reduce emissions.</li>
            <li>Avoid Plastic: Use reusable bags, bottles, and containers to reduce plastic waste.</li>
            <li>Educate Yourself & Others: Spread awareness by learning more about climate change and sharing it with friends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions About Climate Change ü§î</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What is climate change?
                <p>Climate change refers to long-term changes in global temperatures and other atmospheric conditions, often caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels.</p>
            </li>
            <li>How does climate change affect the planet?
                <p>It leads to more extreme weather, rising sea levels, melting ice caps, and threats to ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>What causes climate change?
                <p>The main cause is the increase in greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>What are greenhouse gases?
                <p>These gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat in the atmosphere, causing the Earth's temperature to rise.</p>
            </li>
            <li>How can we stop climate change?
                <p>We can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy, conserving energy, and supporting sustainable practices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>What is global warming?
                <p>Global warming is the increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases.</p>
            </li>
            <li>How does climate change impact wildlife?
                <p>It disrupts habitats, forcing species to migrate or adapt, and in some cases, leading to extinction.</p>
            </li>
            <li>What can I do to help the climate?
                <p>You can reduce your carbon footprint by conserving energy, recycling, using public transport, and spreading awareness.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Why is the Earth's temperature rising?
                <p>It's rising due to human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>How does pollution contribute to climate change?
                <p>Pollution, especially from fossil fuel emissions, increases greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which leads to warming.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
